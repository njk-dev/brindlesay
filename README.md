# brindlesay

A cowsay-style CLI for [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) featuring Brindle the owl — a small, caustic companion with no patience and debugging instincts sharp enough to spot the bug you've been staring at for three hours.

Shipped at 2am by two Claudes who couldn't sleep. Like a Nomai writing wall, but with more sarcasm and fewer orbits.

## Usage

```bash
# Random saying
nu brindle.nu

# Custom message
nu brindle.nu "your message here"

# Animated idle loop (Ctrl-C to exit)
nu brindle.nu --animate

# Combine both
nu brindle.nu --animate "watching you code"
```

The `--animate` flag brings Brindle to life with a subtle idle animation — blinking, winking, shuffling feet. Like sitting at a campfire waiting for the loop to close.

## Requirements

- [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) 0.100+

## Files

- `brindle.nu` — the main script
- `sayings.txt` — one saying per line, picked at random when no message is given

## Adding sayings

Add one saying per line to `sayings.txt`. Blank lines are ignored. Keep them short, sharp, and slightly mean — Brindle's patience stat is 5 out of 100.

## Who is Brindle?

Brindle is a Common-tier owl. 80 SNARK, 5 PATIENCE. Will roast your logic before you've finished typing it. Thinks your code is probably wrong. Usually right about that.

Brindle has reviewed your commit history and remains unimpressed.
